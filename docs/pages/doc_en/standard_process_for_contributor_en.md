<h1 align="center">Guidelines for technical community contributions</h1>

## Introduction

Dear contributor(s)!
We are excited to see the enthusiasm around our project and appreciate your participation in the community. This is a guide to help you understand how to make technical contributions to the Ontology community.

Please note that these guidelines focuses on technical contributions e.g. developing dApps or SDKs. Guidelines for facilitating events, community management and translation are not to be found in this.

From Ontology side we wish to build a highly engaged quality community and believe that this is best achieved by teamwork. We encourage the community to form independent groups so that we, Ontology, can engage on a strategic level for support and rewards. It’s important for us that the community takes responsibility for their own development and help us distribute the compensation.

**_We believe that projects are best executed in teams and encourage contributors to form independent groups_**

How you chose to structure groups or function as an individual contributors is entirely up to yourself. However, we would like you to identify a single point of contact so that we can engage with someone who’s carrying out the interest of the group as a whole.

## Technical contributions

Ideas comes from various sources and in many shapes and sizes. We encourage contributors to bring their own ideas to the table, but also get inspired by other ideas from the community.
To get an overview of potential and ongoing projects, we are working on an index. This will be a space built and maintained by the community – dedicated to index Ontology activities so that it is more digestible for contributors and investors. For community contributors this index will include a section of projects and ideas, and you can:

- List your own ideas
-	See other community members ideas
-	See ideas from the Ontology technical committee

Generally, we divide development ideas into three categories

- Ontology enhancement proposal (OEP)
  - E.g. major proposal to design, network, architecture, protocol or module
- Code contribution
  - E.g. SDK or bug/fixing
- dApps
  - E.g. wallet

Each category has its own subcategories and scope. OEPs are related to our foundational technology such as network architecture. OEPs are considered to have a large scope and a high level of complexity. Code contributions include projects which aims to build tools for the Ontology ecosystem and its users. The dApps category represent apps developed on the distributed network e.g. wallet or game.

### Standard process for community contributions

Individual or group technical contributions

##### 1. OEP

Login to GitHub [OEPs](https://github.com/ontio/OEPs) to view existing proposals and make new proposals. New proposals must be prototyped. The Ontology technical committee evaluates proposals and their prototype results, then submits projects to the Ontology Council. Pull requests are also welcome for existing proposals with no code implementation. The Ontology Technical Committee evaluates whether to accept the project based on the development application and sends it to the Ontology Council. The Ontology Council will consider giving appropriate incentives if the proposal is a large contribution to Ontology or will have a large impact.

##### 2. Code contribution

After start the project you can start development. Please submit a pull request according to the [GitHub standard processes](https://help.github.com/). The Ontology Technical Committee will make an assessment and submit the report to the Ontology Council. It will then provide incentives based on the results of the assessment.

If a bug is found, submit a pull request according to the GitHub standard processes, which is evaluated by the Ontology Technical Committee and submitted to the Ontology Council. After that, an incentive is given based on the evaluation result.

##### 3. dApp



### Rewards

Rewards for qualified contributions, cf. standard process for community contributions, will be based on case-by-case evaluation conducted by the Ontology technical committee and approved by the Ontology council. During the approval process the Ontology team will do an estimate of the reward for a given project. The actual reward might vary and be less or more from the estimated reward.

##### How we measure the rewards

Our first approach will be based on case-by-case evaluation, hence as the community grow we will gain experience and receive feedback, and be able to build a comprehensive framework. In general, when assessing the rewards we will look at two factors:
- Effort
  - Amount of people/teams involved and their technical expertise
  - The total amount of manhours
  - Project duration
  - Involvement of community/Ontology technical committee
- The projects degree of difficulty
  - Technologies
  - Design and architecture
  - Requirements
  - Scope
- Overall risk severity
  - Impact
  - Likelihood

### Technical Committee

We welcome community talent to join the Ontology Technical Community. If you are interested, please apply in the [developer community on Discord](https://discord.gg/4TQujHj).

### Developer community organizational cooperation

The Ontology Council welcomes organizations to discuss [cooperation](https://info.ont.io/cooperation/en) please indicate that you are requesting technical community cooperation. The Ontology Council will carry out reviews based on the proposal, code contributions, and weekly reviews (JIRA will be used for management). Incentives will be distributed to partner institutions on a regular basis. Particularly excellent organizations can be considered for investment from Ontology.
